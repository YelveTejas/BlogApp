<h1>Blog App</h1>
<P>The BlogApp is a MERN stack project that allows users to add, delete, and update their own blogs. Additionally, users can comment on other authors' blogs, but they cannot edit or delete those comments. In the comment section, users can view comments made by others on their own blogs; however, they can only delete comments that they have personally posted.
